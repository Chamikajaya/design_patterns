* The Factory Method design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects,
but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate

* The key components of the Factory Method pattern are:

Product: This is the abstract class or interface that defines the common interface for all products created by the factory method.
ConcreteProduct: These are the concrete subclasses that implement the Product interface.
Creator: This is the abstract class or interface that declares the factory method. It may also provide default implementations for creating objects.
ConcreteCreator: These are the concrete subclasses that override the factory method to create specific instances of products.

Advantage of Factory Design Pattern:
-> Factory Method Pattern allows the sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create.
-> It promotes the loose-coupling

*** VehicleFactory is the abstract Creator, CarFactory and BikeFactory are the ConcreteCreators, and Car and Bike are the ConcreteProducts
