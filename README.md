![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-8%2B-brightgreen.svg)

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of 23 design patterns implemented in Java, along with clear descriptions and practical examples to help you understand and apply these patterns in real-life programming scenarios. I studied and practiced these for PROHGRAMMING CONSTRUCION module in semester 2, 1st year. These design patterns are a crucial part of software engineering and can greatly enhance the quality and maintainability of your code.

## Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They provide a structured and reusable approach to solving specific design challenges, making your code more maintainable and flexible. This repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about and applying design patterns in Java.

## Design Patterns

Here are the 23 design patterns included in this repository, each with its own detailed documentation and practical examples:

1. Creational Patterns

    - Builder
    - Prototype

2. Structural Patterns
    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Flyweight
    - Proxy

3. Behavioral Patterns
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Command
    - Interpreter
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - Observer
    - State
    - Strategy
    - Template Method
    - Visitor
