The Composite Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent
part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Let's take an example of a file system, where a file system is composed of directories and files. A directory can contain other directories or files, but a file cannot contain anything.

Here are the components involved in this pattern:

1. **Component**: This is an abstract class or interface that defines the common methods that will be implemented by all elements of the hierarchy. In our example, this could be an abstract class `FileSystemComponent` with methods like `showDetails()`.

```java
public abstract class FileSystemComponent {
    protected String name;

    public FileSystemComponent(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public abstract void showDetails();
}
```

2. **Leaf**: This is a class that implements the Component and doesn't have any children. It defines the behavior for primitive objects in the composition. In our example, this could be a `File` class.

```java
public class File extends FileSystemComponent {
    public File(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("File: " + name);
    }
}
```

3. **Composite**: This is a class that stores child Components and implements methods defined in the Component.
It defines behavior for components having children and for managing child components. In our example, this could be a `Directory` class.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Directory extends FileSystemComponent {
    private List<FileSystemComponent> children = new ArrayList<>();

    public Directory(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    public void addComponent(FileSystemComponent component) {
        children.add(component);
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Directory: " + name);
        for (FileSystemComponent component : children) {
            component.showDetails();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, both `File` and `Directory` classes are part of the same class hierarchy and they can be used interchangeably by the client code
that doesn't need to know whether it works with a simple file or a complex directory.

The Composite Design Pattern is particularly useful when you're dealing with a hierarchy of objects where you want to treat composite
and individual objects the same way. This pattern allows you to simplify the code by treating all objects in the composite structure uniformly.

Here are some of the main benefits of the Composite Design Pattern:

Simplicity: As you rightly pointed out, client code can treat complex composite objects the same way it would treat a single object.
 This simplifies client code, as it doesn't need to worry about the complexity of the composed objects.

Ease of Use: The Composite Design Pattern makes it easier to add new types of components into the system. You can introduce new kinds of components into the program without breaking the existing code, which now works with the object tree.

Flexibility: It provides a lot of flexibility in terms of structure. Since the composite pattern includes all nodes in the hierarchy, you can structure and restructure your hierarchy at runtime as needed.

Let's go back to our file system example. Suppose you want to add a new feature: displaying the size of files and directories.
With the Composite Design Pattern, you can easily add a new method getSize() in the FileSystemComponent class.
For a File, it can return the size of the file. For a Directory, it can return the total size of all files within that directory.
The client code can call getSize() on any file or directory without needing to know if it's calling on a file or a directory.
