The Mediator pattern is useful when you have a bunch of objects that need to talk to each other.
Instead of having them all talk to each other directly, which can get really complicated really fast, you have them all talk to a mediator,
which handles passing the messages around. This makes your code simpler and easier to understand.

1. **What is it?**: The Mediator pattern is like a chat room. Instead of everyone talking to everyone else directly,
they send their messages to the chat room, and the chat room passes the messages on to the right people.

2. **Mediator**: This is the chat room. It knows about all the people in the chat and can pass messages between them.

3. **Colleagues**: These are the people in the chat room. They can send messages to the chat room and receive messages from the chat room.

4. **Why use it?**: You use the Mediator pattern when you have a bunch of objects that need to talk to each other.
 Instead of having them all talk to each other directly, which can get really complicated really fast,
 you have them all talk to a mediator, which handles passing the messages around.

5. **Benefits**: The Mediator pattern makes your code simpler and easier to understand. It reduces the complexity of communication between objects,
making the system easier to maintain and extend. It also promotes loose coupling between objects, which makes the system more flexible.

Remember, the Mediator pattern is all about simplifying communication between a bunch of objects. Instead of having a mess of direct communications,
you have one mediator that coordinates all the communication.
