2. **Visitors**: These are your tools. Each tool can do something different.

3. **Elements**: These are the things you want to use your tools on.

4. **Why use it?**: You use the Visitor pattern when you have a lot of different tools and you want to be able to use all of them on a set of things ,
without having to change the things themselves.

5. **Benefits**: The Visitor pattern lets you add new tools to your toolbox without having to change the things you're using the tools on.
It keeps your toolbox organized by keeping all the tools in one place.

6. **Example**: Imagine you're a mechanic with a toolbox (Visitor). You have different types of cars (Elements) that you need to fix.
Each car allows you to use any tool from your toolbox on it.

Remember, the Visitor pattern is all about being able to use a set of tools (operations) on a set of things (objects) without having to change
the things themselves. It's like having a universal toolbox for your objects.


*********************************************************************************************************
Of course, let's break down the Visitor design pattern in a simpler way.

The Visitor pattern is like having a toolset that you can use on different objects. Each tool in the set can do something different, but they can all be used on the same set of objects.

Let's imagine you're a repair technician and you have a set of tools (Visitor). You have different types of electronics (Elements) like a TV, a Radio, and a Computer. Each of these electronics has a function that allows you to use a tool on it.

Here's how this looks in code:

1. **Elements (Electronics)**: These are the objects you want to perform operations on. Each electronic device has a method that accepts a tool.

```java
public interface Electronic {
    void accept(Tool tool);
}

public class TV implements Electronic {
    public void accept(Tool tool) {
        tool.useOn(this);
    }
}

public class Radio implements Electronic {
    public void accept(Tool tool) {
        tool.useOn(this);
    }
}
```

2. **Visitor (Toolset)**: This is an interface that defines a method for each type of electronic. Each tool in the set is used on a specific type of electronic.

```java
public interface Tool {
    void useOn(TV tv);
    void useOn(Radio radio);
}

public class Screwdriver implements Tool {
    public void useOn(TV tv) {
        System.out.println("Using screwdriver on TV.");
    }

    public void useOn(Radio radio) {
        System.out.println("Using screwdriver on Radio.");
    }
}

public class Hammer implements Tool {
    public void useOn(TV tv) {
        System.out.println("Using hammer on TV.");
    }

    public void useOn(Radio radio) {
        System.out.println("Using hammer on Radio.");
    }
}
```

3. **Usage**: You can now create a TV and a Radio, and use different tools on them.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Electronic tv = new TV();
        Electronic radio = new Radio();

        Tool screwdriver = new Screwdriver();
        Tool hammer = new Hammer();

        tv.accept(screwdriver);  // Output: Using screwdriver on TV.
        radio.accept(hammer);  // Output: Using hammer on Radio.
    }
}
```

In this example, the `TV` and `Radio` classes are the elements. They have an `accept()` method that takes a tool. The `Screwdriver` and `Hammer` classes are the visitors. They can be used on any electronic that accepts a tool.

The Visitor pattern allows you to add new operations (tools) without changing the classes of the elements (electronics) you work with. It also allows you to add new elements by creating a new class and implementing the `accept()` method.
