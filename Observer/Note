1. **What is it?**: The Observer pattern is like a newspaper subscription.
The newspaper (subject) automatically sends new editions (notifications) to all subscribers (observers) when they are published (state change).

2. **Subject**: This is the newspaper. It keeps a list of observers and notifies them when its state changes.

3. **Observers**: These are the subscribers. They get notified and receive the new edition when it's published.

4. **Why use it?**: You use the Observer pattern when you have one-to-many dependencies between objects,
such as one subject being observed by multiple observers. It allows you to notify dependent objects automatically when the state of the subject changes.

5. **Benefits**: The Observer pattern makes your code more flexible and easier to manage.
You can add and remove observers dynamically and notify all observers automatically. This makes the code easier to maintain and extend.

Remember, the Observer pattern is all about automatic notification.
Instead of having to update each observer manually, you can notify all observers automatically whenever the subject's state changes.
This makes your code more efficient and easier to understand.
