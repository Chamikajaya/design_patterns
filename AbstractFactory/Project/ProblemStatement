Scenario: Building a Cross-Platform Mobile Application

You are tasked with developing a mobile application that should run on both Android and iOS platforms.
The application needs to have a consistent look and feel on both platforms while utilizing native UI components.

To solve this problem using the Abstract Factory pattern:

Define the abstract factory interface:
Create an abstract class or interface called UIComponentFactory that declares factory methods for creating UI components such as buttons,
text fields. These factory methods should return interfaces or abstract classes representing the native UI components.

Implement concrete factories: Create concrete factory classes for Android and iOS platforms, such as AndroidUIComponentFactory and iOSUIComponentFactory.
Each concrete factory should implement the UIComponentFactory interface and provide the implementation for creating UI components specific to the
respective platform.

Implement UI components: Create the necessary classes for UI components like AndroidButton, AndroidTextField, iOSButton, iOSTextField, etc.
These classes should implement interfaces or extend abstract classes that represent the native UI components of their respective platforms.

Build the mobile application: Develop the mobile application using the abstract factory pattern.
The application should utilize the concrete factories to create UI components based on the platform it is running on.
This way, the application can ensure a consistent user experience while leveraging the native capabilities of each platform.
